# Redux Topic Search App

A Redux demo application to search user specified topics. 
Its aim is to demonstrate how to handle asynchronous workflow in Redux app using redux-thunk.

The app uses Twitter Rest API to query tweets of topics.

## Twitter API 1.1 needs to be called on server

Looks like Twitter Rest API v1.1 should be called from server side. So A small api need to be built to serve the purpose.

I will build it using Django Rest Framework.

## Run the app

Clone the repository 

run `npm install` to install dependency.

run `npm start` to start webserver

open `http://localhost:3004/` in browser to see the demo app.
